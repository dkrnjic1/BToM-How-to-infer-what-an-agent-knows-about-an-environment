# Machine Theory of Mind: How to make robots learn about the minds of other robots or humans
This study aims to explore the relationship between ToM depth and agent performance in repeated social games, using simulated environments and controlled agent competitions. 
The study hypothesizes that increasing the recursive depth of Theory of Mind (ToM) beyond level 3 yields diminishing returns in agent performance within repeated social games.
